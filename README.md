## 🧠 Project Overview
This project simulates the responsibilities of a data analyst working with real-world business data.
I used a global retail dataset to perform end-to-end analysis of sales and profit trends, built interactive dashboards in Power BI, and provided actionable insights across time, location, products, and customer segments.

## 🎯 Objectives
Analyze monthly profit and sales trends to identify seasonal patterns.

Track regional and state performance to detect underperforming areas.

Identify top-selling and most profitable products.

Evaluate shipping types, customer segments, and profit margins.
